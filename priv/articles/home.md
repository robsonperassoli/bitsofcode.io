# About me
I'm Robson Perassoli, a software engineer who gets genuinely excited about solving problems with code. I've spent years building and refining systems, and I still love it. When I'm not coding, I spend my time brewing beer, getting my hands dirty in the garden, and fumbling my way through learning photography. I'm driven by curiosity and love the process of learning new things.
